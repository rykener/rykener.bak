      <p>My name is Eleanor Rykener, I am a disabled trans woman who has been dealing with my own chronic illness and pain for over 20 years. I believe that we can all access healing no matter how chronic or incurable our illness is. I work with clients at all stages of illness to help them gain a sense of control over their lives and to help foster a feeling of acceptance. Acceptance does not mean rolling over and giving up, but instead means radically looking at the truth of our own lives. Only then, once we come to a place of acceptance, can we most effectively start moving forward into a place of healing, whether that be physical, emotional, or spiritual in nature.</p><p>Aside from this modality of healing, I work with my clients on practical means of improving daily life. This includes assistance with navigating the medical system, disability insurance, symptom tracking, accessability, dealing with (un)supportive family, and so much more. I have lived fully while experiencing extreme illness. I know what's possible for us and I know what is realistic.</p><p>I am a certified coach through the National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching. I am additionally a certified crisis responder for THRIVE Lifeline and have completed Mental Health First Aid training. I have been practicing Zen Buddhism for the vast majority of my adult life, having even lived residentially in a temple for a number of years. I bring all of my various trainings forward when working with clients to help people best meet the moment.</p><p>I practice covid safety in my day to day life, recognizing that, even now, we are in the middle of a pandemic that disables thousands of people daily.</p><p><i>I am not a doctor, a lawyer, a nurse, or any of that other stuff. I am here to walk alongside you while you deal with the complicated and often degrading systems we are forced to endure as patients. I cannot give you medical or legal advice.</i></p>
