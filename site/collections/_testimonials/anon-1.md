blurb: I just wanna say thank you for being such a beam of good. I've grown to really appreciate your dedication and your perspective on being an older transfem and owning that position as a compassionate member of the trans community to younger transfolk. A lot of transfems in thier mid 30s or older I've met and spent time with one on one definitely haven't treated me the best and always kinda made me feel weird and looked down upon. I'm only 25 and if I make it to be older, I wanna adopt your compassion.
